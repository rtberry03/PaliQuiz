This application is based on numerous tutorials and lessons found online, most importantly that of Robert Hinds.  
I created it to help me learn PƒÅli, and as a gift of dana to other students.<br>

<u><b>Vocabulary Notes:</b></u><br>
<br>
<b>(1)   </b>New nouns are introduced in the format:<br>
<b>stem-form</b> <b>{-nom. s. ending}</b><br>
<br>e.g. <b>dhamma {-o}</b><br>
<br>
<b>(2)   </b>In some instances, I'm amending the definitions as given in the text, usually to expand on a word's meaning, 
or perhaps favoring neutral interpretations in cases of academic debate.<br>
<br>e.g.  The text lists Sugata (a title of the Buddha) simply  as 'the Buddha'.  I've listed the meaning as 
'the Buddha (Well-Gone)'.<br>
